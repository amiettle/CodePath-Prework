App idea: A platform for cat enthusiasts to cherish and document the precious moments with their feline companions. 
This app will serve as a digital cat journal, allowing users to record daily activities, moods, and health updates of their cats. 
Users can easily upload photos, track milestones, and set reminders for essential tasks such as vet appointments.

## Notes

Some instructions were vague and made it difficult to follow along as a first time user of XCode, but googling helped me to gain more clarity.
